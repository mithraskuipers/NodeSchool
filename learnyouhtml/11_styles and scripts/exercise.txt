You can add special resources to your page, like styles or scripts.

Styles
A web page can be stylized using CSS stylesheets.
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
written in HTML.

You can include CSS on your page with <style> tag, used to contain style information for a (part of a) document.
By default the style instructions that are written inside that eement are expected to be CSS.

Example of <style> tag

<style type = "text/css">
body {
	color: red;
}
</style>

Another way to inject styles in your web page is to link a styles file using <link> tag. 
The <link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.

<link> important attributes:
href: specifies the URL of the linked resource. Can be absolute or relative.
rel: names a relationship of the linked document to the current document.

To include a stylesheet in a page, use the following syntax:

<link href = "style.css" rel = "stylesheet">
It is better to include styles in the <head> element.



Scripts
Besides styles, you can also include some JavaScript logic in an HTML document. 
This is where the <script> tag comes into play.

<script> is used to embed or reference an exectuable script.
<script> important attributes:
src: specifies the URI of an external script. Can be used as an alternative to embedding
	a script directly within a document. If a script element has src attribute specified it should
	not have a script embedded inside its tags.
type: specifies the scripting language of code embedded within a script element or referenced via 
	the element's src attribute.
async: set this Boolean attribute to indicate that the browser should, if possible, execute the
	script asynchronously.
defer:	this Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after
	the document has been parsed.

Example of an inline script:
<script>
	console.log("Hello, world!");
</script>

Reference script in external file:
<script src = "javascript.js"></script>

It is better to include scripts before closing of <body> element.



## THE CHALLENGE

Create a web page with one inline style, one linked stylesheet and one
inline script or one referenced script.

After all, verify your document with learnyouhtml verify when you get a
solution.
