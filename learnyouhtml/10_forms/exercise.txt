Now we learn how to make sign-up pages with input fields for email or username and password.

You need to start from <form> element, which represents a document section that contains interactive
controls to submit information to a web server.

<form> has many attributes, the most important ones are:

action: the URI of a program that processes the form information.
method: the HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form.
	possible values are: 
		post (which corresponds to the HTTP POST method)
		get (which corresponds to the HTTP GET method)
		
name: the name of the form. This must be unique among the forms in a document.


Now that you know what <form> is, you also need to know what <input> is.
<input> is the element used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in
order to accept data from the user. 

How an <input> works depends on the value of its type attribute.




type attribute has many values, the most important ones are:

text: a single-line text file. Line-breaks are autom. removed.
button: a push button with no default behavior.
checkbox: a check box. You must define the value attribute to indicate whether this item is selected by default.
file: lets user select a file.
password: a single-line text field whose value is obscured.
radio: a radio button. You must define the value attribute to indicate whether this item is selected by default.
submit: a button that submits the form.
