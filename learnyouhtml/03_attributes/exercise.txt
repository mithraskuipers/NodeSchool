Tag attributes extend the ability of tags and provide flexible control over a variety of options
for displaying elements or configuring their behavior. There are many attributes for different purposes,
such as color, size, address.

An attribute can be specified like this:

Fully written

<tag attribute1 = "value1" attribute2 = "value2">some text</tag>

Written with self-closing tag
<tag attribute1 = "value1" attribute2 = "value2">

The HTML specification mandates that all values of attributes are wrapped in double quotes (attribute = "value")
or single quotes (attribute = 'value'). Omitting these quotes do not cause errors, because browsers are smart.
But can lead to problems if you try to define a value with spaces and don't wrap this value in quotes, such as:

<tag attribute="value with spaces"></tag> <- here "value with spaces" will be considered a value which is good!
<tag attribute=value with spaces></tag>  <- here only "value" will be considered a value

If you do not specify an attribute (means not giving attribute value), 
then the browser will use the default values for that attribute.

The order of the attributes does not matter.
Each attribute requires a specific type o value (text, number, path to file, etc.)


## THE CHALLENGE

You're already familiar with the <img> tag from the previous exercise.
This tag embeds an image in the page. This tag has a few important
attributes:

» src - the image URL. This attribute is mandatory for the <img> element.
» alt - this attribute defines the alternative text describing the image.                                         
 Users will see this text displayed if the image URL is wrong or if the                                          
 image is not yet downloaded.
» height - the intrinsic height of the image in pixels.
» width - the intrinsic width of the image in pixels.

You need to create an HTML document with an image. Feel free to set any
values for src and alt attributes.

# Own notes

Place img tag in body tags.
<img 
src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/77/EricCartman.png/220px-EricCartman.png"
alt = "Cartman picture"
