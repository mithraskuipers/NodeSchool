HTML allows for making 3 types of lists:
Ordered list
Unordered list
Definitions list

Ordered list
An ordered list is a list with numbered items. 
<ol> represents an ordered list of items, rendered as a numbered list.

A list item can be specified using <li>, which stands for list item.

<ol>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

Ordered lists are displayed with a preceding numbering, which can be of any form, like numerals, letters,
or Romans numerals, and even simple bullets.

The <ol> tag has useful attributes:
type: 
indicates the numbering type. 
1 indicates numbers (default)
a indicates lowercase letters
A indicates uppercase letters
i indicates lowercase Roman numerals
I indicates uppercase Roman numerals

start: 
indicates the start value for numbering the list items. 

reversed:
a boolean attribute that specifies that the items of the list are in reversed order.

Unordered list

Look similar to ordered lists, there is just no ordering, and only bullet-like symbols.
Specifying them is also the same as like ordered lists.
Instead of <ol> you use <ul>.

<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

The <ul> tag has useful properties:
type:
circle
disc
square


Definition lists
Used to create a glossary or to display a list of key-value pairs (much like a glossary 8-) !)
<dl> represents a definition list and is used to enclose a list of groups of terms and descriptions.

Terms are enclosed in <dt> tag, which means definition term.
Definitions are enclosed in <dd> tags.

So:
	<dl>
		<dt>
			Hoofdstuk 1:
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Pindakaas
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Hoofdstuk 2:
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Hagelslag
		</dd>
	</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>HTML</dt>
	<dd>
		The standard markup language for
		creating web pages and web applications.
	</dd>
	<!-- Other terms and descriptions -->
</dl>

You can also write multiple terms with single definition, single term with my multiple definitions or multiple
terms with multiple definitions.



## THE CHALLENGE

In your HTML document create three lists:

1. ordered list with 3 items
2. unordered list with 3 items
3. definition list with 2 pairs of term and definition

The content of list items is up to you.

There are cases when it is not enough to summarize information in a simple list. 
That is where tables come in to play. See the next exercise.
