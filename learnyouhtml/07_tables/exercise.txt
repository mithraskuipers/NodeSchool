In HTML you create a table with the <table> tag.
Rows are created with <tr> (= table row) and columns <tcd> (= table data)

For example

<table>
<tr>
	<td>1.1</td>
	<td>1.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2.1</td>
	<td>2.2</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can add a heading row using <th> (= table head) tag.

Important:
The number of table headers determine the number of columns there will be, in a way...
I can create a table with 3 table headers, but actually consisting of a 2x2 grid.
We will then have a third flying table header to the right of the 2nd table header 
(which sits correctly above column 2).

<p>Simple table with header</p>
	<table>
	<tr>
		<th>First name</th>
		<th>Last name</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>John</td>
		<td>Doe</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Jane</td>
		<td>Doe</td>
	</tr>
</table>


## THE CHALLENGE

Create this table:

╔══════════╦══════════╦══════════╗
║  Europe  ║   Asia   ║  Africa  ║
╠══════════╬══════════╬══════════╣
║ Ukraine  ║ China    ║ Egypt    ║
╠══════════╬══════════╬══════════╣
║ Poland   ║ India    ║ Kenya    ║
╠══════════╬══════════╬══════════╣
║ Italy    ║ Thailand ║ Sudan    ║
╚══════════╩══════════╩══════════╝

Above, first row is a heading row, so you should use <th> tag.

After all, check your document with learnyouhtml verify.

Here are few important notes about tables:

» You can put one table in a cell of other table.
» The table dimensions are not set initially. They are calculated based                                            
on the contents of the cells.
» If the table is given its width in percent or pixels, then the contents                                          
of the table are adjusted to the specified sizes.
» Browser doesn't display tables until they are loaded. That's because                                             
browser needs to calculate table's dimensions, before displaying.

In following exercise we will consider block tags and their semantic.
