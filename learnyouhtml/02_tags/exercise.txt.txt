HTML uses special bits of programming called "tags" to let the browser know 
what a page should look like.

Almost all tags come in pairs: an opening tag and an ending tag.
There are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose.

Opening tags have a keyword, like "p" surrounded by angle brackets <>. 
Opening tag <p> tells the browser to start a new paragraph.
Ending tags look almost identical to the corresponding opening tag, but start with </ instead of <.
<p>This is a paragraph</p>

A small number of tags can be used without an ending tag: <br>,<img>,<hr>
<br> produces a line break
<img> represents an image
<hr> represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements.

In the previous exercise we made the following index.html file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Hello, world!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		here is a body
	</body>
</html>

The <html> tag wraps the entire document. It indicates where the HTML document begins and ends.

The HTML document has a <head> and <body>.
In the <head> tag we put all the information about the document, like meta-tags, <title>
The contents of the <title> tag will be shown in the browser's title bar when the file is run.

In the <body> we put everything we want to be drawn in the browser's window, such as headings, text, images.

The <meta charset = "utf-8"> tag is a special tag. A so-called "meta-tag", recognisable by the "meta".
In general, ,eta-tags are used for describing a document. That is, they provide information about information.

In this case it means we want to use the utf-8 charset for our document.

In this case we have a meta tag with the attribute "charset", with corresponding attribute value "utf-8"

## THE CHALLENGE

You already have an HTML-document. In <body> add two paragraphs (<p>) with
any text you like. Please, separate these two tags with a horizontal rule
(<hr> tag).

Don't forget to check your solution, run learnyouhtml verify to verify.


# Post completion feedback:

Tag are case insensitive.
<br>, <BR>, <Br> are all identical. 
Still we recommend to write tags in lower case (generally accepted).
If a tag is written with a mistake the browser will ignore this tag, so it looks like there is no tag at all.
