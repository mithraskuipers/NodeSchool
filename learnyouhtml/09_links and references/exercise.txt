Links are the basis of hypertext documents and allow you to move from 1 web page to another.
To create a link you need to tell the browser what the link is and the address of the document
to which you want to link. Both actions are done using the <a> tag, which stands for "anchor".

<a href = "https://google.com/">Google</a>
See that href is an attribute of the <a> tag? 
That attribute contains a URL or URL fragment that the hyperlink points to.

<a> also has other attributes such as:

download: instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it.
target: specifies where to display the linked URL. Is it a browsing context? tab? window?

You can also put an image inside of a link, so you get an clickable image like this:

<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">
	<img src="path/to/google-logo.png" alt="Google logo" />
</a>

Here we define a link to Google's main page using an image. 


To open a link in a new window:
target = "_blank"

To open a link to an emailaddress in the user's email program:
mailto:
<a href = "mailto:mithraskuipers@gmail.com">Send email to Mithras Kuipers</a>

## THE CHALLENGE

In this exercise you have to create a clickable image (link with image).
Use any image and any link you like.
